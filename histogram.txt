Here's an implementation of a histogram line diff algorithm in JavaScript: 
function histogramLineDiff(text1, text2) {
  const lines1 = text1.split('\n');
  const lines2 = text2.split('\n');

  const histogram1 = createHistogram(lines1);
  const histogram2 = createHistogram(lines2);

  const diff = [];
  let i = 0;
  let j = 0;

  while (i < lines1.length || j < lines2.length) {
    if (histogram1[lines1[i]] > 0 && histogram2[lines1[i]] > 0) {
      diff.push({ type: 'equal', value: lines1[i] });
      histogram1[lines1[i]]--;
      histogram2[lines1[i]]--;
      i++;
      j++;
    } else if (i < lines1.length && (j >= lines2.length || histogram1[lines1[i]] > 0)) {
      diff.push({ type: 'delete', value: lines1[i] });
      i++;
    } else {
      diff.push({ type: 'insert', value: lines2[j] });
      j++;
    }
  }

  return diff;
}

function createHistogram(lines) {
  const histogram = {};
  for (const line of lines) {
    histogram[line] = (histogram[line] || 0) + 1;
  }
  return histogram;
}

This code defines two functions: histogramLineDiff and createHistogram. The histogramLineDiff function takes two strings as input, splits them into lines, creates histograms of the lines, and then compares the histograms to generate a diff. The createHistogram function takes an array of lines and returns a histogram object. 
The histogramLineDiff function returns an array of diff objects, where each object has a type property (either "equal", "delete", or "insert") and a value property (the line that was added, deleted, or remained the same).
